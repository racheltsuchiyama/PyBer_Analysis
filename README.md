# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyse data to help improve the accessibility and affordability of the ride-sharing app PyBer. I assessed the fares, number of drivers, and number of riders in the urban, suburban, and rural cities.

## Resources
### Data
city_data.csv

ride_data.csv

### Software
Python 3.6.1

Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0

## Results

I compared the ride-sharing data between urban, suburban, and rural city types and summarized the results in the table below.

### Total Rides

Urban cities had the highest number of total rides while rural cities had the lowest number of total rides. The majority of the total rides were taken in urban cities, while the rural cities had the smallest percentage of the total rides. However, urban cities had a slight advantage because there was the highest number of urban city types in the dataset and the smallest number of rural city types.


### Total Drivers

The number of drivers was much higher in urban cities when compared to suburban and rural cities, as displayed in the pie chart below:

However, it may be more helpful to examine the box and whisker plots for the city types:

The number of drivers for urban cities varied drastically, while the number of drivers for suburban and rural cities covered a much smaller range.


### Total Fares

As shown in the table below, the urban cities had the highest total fares. However, the urban cities had the highest driver and rides count, so this conclusion was expected. However, the box and whisker plot of the fare data showed that rural cities had higher fares. On average, urban cities had lower fares than suburban cities, and suburban cities had lower fares than rural cities. The range of fares for urban and suburban cities was approximately equal, but the range of fares for rural cities was larger.

### Average Fare per Ride and per Driver

The total rides, total drivers, and total fares for each city type were used to determine the average fare per ride and average fare per driver:

Rural cities had the highest average fare per rider and per driver. Although urban cities had the highest number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares, they had the lowest fares per ride and driver.

### Total Fare by City Type

## Summary

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
